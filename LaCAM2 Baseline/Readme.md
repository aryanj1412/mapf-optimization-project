### LaCAM2 Algorithm (IJCAI 2023)

**Paper:** [*Improving LaCAM for Scalable Eventually Optimal Multi-Agent Pathfinding*](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2023/28)  
**Author:** Keisuke Okumura (AIST & University of Cambridge)  
**Conference:** IJCAI-23 (International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence)  
**ArXiv:** [2305.03632](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03632)

### Algorithm Overview

LaCAM2 (LaCAM*) is an **anytime search-based algorithm** that combines the speed of sub-optimal methods with eventual convergence to optimal solutions. It extends the original LaCAM algorithm with two key enhancements:

#### Key Innovations:

1. **Lazy Successor Generation**
   - Uses adaptive PIBT (Priority Inheritance with Backtracking) to generate configurations
   - Dramatically reduces planning effort by avoiding exhaustive branching
   - Enables handling of 1,000+ agents on standard hardware

2. **Anytime Optimality**
   - Quickly finds initial sub-optimal solutions
   - Continues refining solution quality as computation time allows
   - Guarantees eventual convergence to optimal solutions (for sum-of-costs objective)

3. **Improved Configuration Generation**
   - Enhanced PIBT with "swap" operation detection
   - Prevents search from getting stuck in bottleneck situations
   - Significantly reduces search iterations in narrow passages

### Performance Characteristics

**Strengths:**
- âœ… **Complete:** Always finds a solution if one exists
- âœ… **Eventually Optimal:** Converges to optimal solution given sufficient time
- âœ… **Scalable:** Handles 1,000+ agents within seconds
- âœ… **Anytime:** Returns improving solutions over time

**Benchmark Results:**
- Solved **99% of MAPF benchmark instances** within 10 seconds
- Handles grids up to **128Ã—128** with varying agent counts
- Supports multiple objectives: makespan, sum-of-costs, flowtime
